# 🖨️ OpenSCAD 3D Printing Models

Welcome to my 3D models repository!

I created this repository because I love designing models using code in **OpenSCAD**. Here you will find a collection of my various projects. Since they are written in OpenSCAD, most models are fully **parametric** and customizable.

## 🔗 Thingiverse
You can also view my designs and prints on my Thingiverse account:
👉 **[JacobsFarm Designs](https://www.thingiverse.com/JacobsFarm/designs)**

## 📂 Repository Structure
Since I work on a variety of different things, this repository is organized into folders per project. In each folder, you will typically find:
* 📜 **.scad file:** The source code (allows you to modify the model).
* 🧊 **.stl file:** The file ready to be sliced for your 3D printer.
* 📝 **Readme/Info:** Specific instructions for that model.

## 🚀 How to use these files
Do you want to modify a model (e.g., adjust the thickness or size)?
1.  Download and install [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/).
2.  Download this repository (or just the `.scad` file you need).
3.  Open the file in OpenSCAD.
4.  Adjust the variables in the code or use the *Customizer* window.
5.  Press `F6` to render and `F7` to export as STL.
